# WeatherDashboard
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
# Application Features
The application takes the City the user has entered and displays the current forecast and 5 day forcast.
It saves your recent searches and displays them to see what the user has out in before.
It allows to have multiple searches ongoing at once.
# Key feature
This application is gettting all its information from an API weather key.
The API weather has multiple functions to display.
(The application does not save the most recent search)
It only shows the most recent searches but refreshes upon reloading the page.
